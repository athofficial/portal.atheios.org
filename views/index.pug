    | When You develop a game there are a lot of things to take care of: the game idea, graphics, motion, physics and from where do I get the music, monetization...? Here is where we step in. We provide You a framework to earn some serious Atheios. We make Your game rewarding for people being good at it. How? Hear us out.

    | Martin found this great game designed by You. When starting the game, the game offers him to register on the Atheios play portal for free and offers a start of 10 ATH to wage.
    | Martin likes the game and get's good at it: with each gameplay he wages 1 Atheios (1 ATH) to play. After some training he has a good position in the leader board.
    | If others join the game play everybody spend Atheios and contribute to the top players and the game developers.
    | After a certain criteria (ie 50 games played, or after a day, or after a week) the “payday” comes and the funds are distributed back. By now lets say 50 Atheios are in the pot.
    | They can be then distributed by a certain rule: first place gets maybe 30%, 2nd place 20% and 3rd place 10%. 40% would go to You the game developer.
    | We think this concept, powered by blockchain technology, can change the gaming market...

  p We have developed a 3rd party module for Construct 3. As a game developer You can add Atheios as a third party module to offer Your players a possibility to use Atheios for gaming.
  p The add-on is free of charge and enables You to earn Atheios with every game, but also provides statistics about Your game and much more. You can download the module
